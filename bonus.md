# Bonus tasks

- Require that the CI (PR) `format-lint-test` job passes before a PR can be merged
- Add a CI badge on the project readme
- Create a pre-commit hook with Husky and lint-staged so that Prettier and ESLint run locally and automatically before commits
- Keep track of code coverage with Codecov.io
